### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Download the SRC Folder** and import it into the **nitro-client** files you have installed and build. 
Then you need to build to migrate to your hotel and use this command for this: `npm run build-prod`

I will instantly integrate and share nitro updates as soon as possible

The files will not work without jquery and will generate an error, enter the `npm install jquery â€” save` command in the nitro-client home directory with cmd.

Since we do not use nitro image files, if you do not create a new image path, the images in the hotel will not appear!
Go to the cms file where Nitro is installed and create a new assets file, enter the file into the file src/assets/images in the CoreloGAMES â„¢ file and put all the images in the assets file you created in cms.
